            <p>processing of information, based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public
                interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);</p>

                objection online to our mail support@social-sale.rubic.chat.</p>
            <h4>The right of access</h4>
            <p>You have the right to access your personal data. The reason to access your personal data is so that you
                are aware of and can verify the lawfulness of the processing. We may verify the identity of the person
                making the request, using reasonable means. If the request is made electronically, we shall provide you
                with the information in a commonly used electronic format. You have the right to obtain:</p>
            <p>confirmation that your data is being processed;</p>
            <p>access to your personal data;</p>
            <p>and other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided
                in a privacy notice.</p>
            <h4>The right to rectification</h4>
            <p>This means the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or completed if it is incomplete.
                Personal data is inaccurate if it is incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact. In certain
                circumstances, we can refuse a request for rectification.</p>
            <h4>The right to erasure</h4>
            <p>You have the right to have your personal data erased. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’.
                The right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances, for example:</p>
            <p>the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose which we originally collected or processed it
                for;</p>
            <p>you withdraw your consent for processing personal information;</p>
            <p>we have to do it to comply with a legal obligation;</p>

            <h4>The right to restrict processing</h4>
            <p>When processing is restricted, we can store the personal data, but not use it. You can make a request for
                restriction. This is an alternative to requesting the erasure of your data. The personal information can
                be restricted by:</p>
            <p>temporarily moving information to another processing system;</p>
            <p>making the data unavailable to users; or</p>
            <p>temporarily removing published data from a website.</p>
            <h4>The right to data portability</h4>
            <p>This right means that you can obtain your personal information from us and reuse it for your own purposes
                – to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from our site to another sites or services. We shall
                provide the personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form.
                Machine-readable means that the information is structured so that software can extract specific elements
                of the data. This enables other organizations to use the data. If you want it, we may transmit the
                personal information directly to another organization (site or service) if this is technically feasible.
            </p>
            <p>We don’t use automated decision making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human
                involvement) or profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an
                individual) systems.</p>
            <h4>What are the rules for submitting requests and considering them?</h4>
            <p>You can make the requests with regard to the rights set forth above, verbally or in writing. Requests
                will be handled within thirty (30) days. The period of compliance can be extended by a further two
                months where requests are complex or numerous. If this is the case, we shall inform you within one month
                of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary.</p>
            <p>Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular, because they are repetitive, we may
                charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or
                refuse to respond.</p>
            <p>If we refuse to respond to a request, we will explain the reason of that and inform you of your right to
                complain to the supervisory authority and to a judicial remedy without undue delay and at the latest
                within one month. Anyway, we shall explain our decision and inform you of your rights.</p>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to
                protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If
                you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us via our mail
                support@social-sale.rubic.chat.</p>
